# Trash / Archive – Deprecated Services

This directory acts as an **archive for retired, unused, or experimental services** that are no longer active in the Sisyphus homelab stack but are preserved for reference, rollback, or learning purposes.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this folder is to:

* Preserve old service configurations and setups
* Retain learning artifacts from experiments and PoCs
* Allow quick rollback if a service is needed again
* Keep the active homelab stack clean and minimal

Nothing in this directory is expected to be running in production.

---

## What Goes Here

Typical contents include:

* Deprecated Docker Compose files
* Old LXC / VM configuration notes
* Abandoned service experiments
* One-off prototypes and failed ideas
* Services replaced by better alternatives

---

## Documentation Guidelines

For every archived service, try to include:

* **What the service did**
* **Why it was stopped** (unused, resource-heavy, replaced, unstable)
* **Replacement or alternative** (if any)
* **Date of decommissioning**

This keeps the archive useful instead of becoming a graveyard.

---

## Important Notes

* Services in this folder are **not maintained**
* Configurations may be outdated or insecure
* Do **not deploy directly to production** without review

---

## Philosophy

> Experiments are never wasted — even the failed ones.

This folder represents iteration, learning, and evolution of the homelab. Every archived service contributed something to the current, cleaner setup.
